CityStayNL is a full-stack location-based real estate web application designed to address the growing need for rental and purchase properties in St. Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland. With the **significant increase in immigrants, particularly international students, over the past few years**, CityStayNL aims to simplify the process of finding affordable and convenient housing for newcomers.

This repository contains the frontend code for the application, built using **React**, **React-Leaflet**, and **Material UI**.
